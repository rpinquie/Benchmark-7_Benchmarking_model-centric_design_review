# Benchmark 7. Model-Centric Design Reviews

The Benchmark-7_Benchmarking_model-centric_design_review aims at benchmarking solutions for reviewing model-centric designs.


## Introduction

Write a short introduction of the benchmark that includes at least the following items:

- Type of research (qualitative and/or quantitative)
- Main discipline(s) it contributes to
- The goal of the study (to understand or improve design)
- The type of contribution (theory to knowledge or empirical to practice)
- Objects to validate (theory, method, tool, process...)
- Expected results

## Glossary

To share a common undestanding of ambiguous concepts, contributors shall agree upon meaning of the key concepts by systematically providing a definition and potential synonyms.
- Concept1: Definition 1. 
- Concept2: Definition 2.
- ... 

## Goals

Specify the common set of goals that the competing solutions pursue:
- The solution shall enable to...
- The solution shall enable to...
- The solution shall enable to...

# Solutions

In the folder named [solutions](), you should collect the competing solutions.
